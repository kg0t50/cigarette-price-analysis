# Cigarette Price Analysis

## Overview
This project analyses cigarette pricing data to uncover trends, price sensitivity, and potential economic implications.  
The study focuses on understanding how cigarette prices vary across observations and how these prices relate to consumption and broader market behaviour.

The analysis was conducted using **R**, with an emphasis on clean data preparation, exploratory analysis, and statistical modelling.

---

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw cigarette price data  
- Explore price distributions and trends  
- Analyse relationships between price and consumption  
- Apply regression techniques to estimate price sensitivity  
- Present results in a clear, reproducible manner

   - Removal of missing or inconsistent values  
   - Standardisation of price units  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution analysis  
   - Price trend visualisation  
   - Correlation analysis  

3. **Statistical Modelling**  
   - Linear regression models  
   - Interpretation of coefficients  
   - Discussion of economic implications

## Tools & Technologies
- **R**
- tidyverse
- ggplot2
- dplyr
- readr

---

## Reproducibility
To reproduce the analysis:
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open `cigarette-price-analysis.Rproj` in RStudio  
3. Run scripts in numerical order from the `scripts/` directory  

---

## Key Findings
- Cigarette prices show notable variation across observations  
- Regression results indicate measurable price sensitivity  
- The findings align with established economic theory on excise goods  

(Full results are available in the `reports/` directory.)
